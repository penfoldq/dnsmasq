# Configuration file for dnsmasq.
#
# Format is one option per line, legal options are the same
# as the long options legal on the command line. See
# "/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --help" or "man 8 dnsmasq" for details.

# Listen on this specific port instead of the standard DNS port
# (53). Setting this to zero completely disables DNS function,
# leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.
#port=5353

#penfoldq : port 53 is perfect. leave it be.
#

# The following two options make you a better netizen, since they
# tell dnsmasq to filter out queries which the public DNS cannot
# answer, and which load the servers (especially the root servers)
# unnecessarily. If you have a dial-on-demand link they also stop
# these requests from bringing up the link unnecessarily.

# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
#domain-needed
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.
#bogus-priv

#penfoldq : yes we want to do this.
domain-needed
bogus-priv
#

# Uncomment this to filter useless windows-originated DNS requests
# which can trigger dial-on-demand links needlessly.
# Note that (amongst other things) this blocks all SRV requests,
# so don't use it if you use eg Kerberos, SIP, XMMP or Google-talk.
# This option only affects forwarding, SRV records originating for
# dnsmasq (via srv-host= lines) are not suppressed by it.
#filterwin2k

#penfoldq : no win2k machines present or expected. but XMMP might happen
#           so leave this off.
#

# Change this line if you want dns to get its upstream servers from
# somewhere other that /etc/resolv.conf
#resolv-file=

#penfoldq : /etc/resolv.conf _should_ be fine.
#

# By  default,  dnsmasq  will  send queries to any of the upstream
# servers it knows about and tries to favour servers to are  known
# to  be  up.  Uncommenting this forces dnsmasq to try each query
# with  each  server  strictly  in  the  order  they   appear   in
# /etc/resolv.conf
#strict-order

#penfoldq : don't care.
#

# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/resolv.conf or any other
# file, getting its servers from this file instead (see below), then
# uncomment this.
#no-resolv

#penfoldq : nope, want /etc/resolv.conf.
#

# If you don't want dnsmasq to poll /etc/resolv.conf or other resolv
# files for changes and re-read them then uncomment this.
#no-poll

#penfoldq : polling should be fine.
#

# Add other name servers here, with domain specs if they are for
# non-public domains.
#server=/localnet/192.168.0.1

#penfoldq : let /etc/resolv.conf handle this.
#

# Example of routing PTR queries to nameservers: this will send all
# address->name queries for 192.168.3/24 to nameserver 10.1.2.3
#server=/3.168.192.in-addr.arpa/10.1.2.3

#penfoldq : nope.
#

# Add local-only domains here, queries in these domains are answered
# from /etc/hosts or DHCP only.
#local=/localnet/

#penfoldq : nope.
#

# Add domains which you want to force to an IP address here.
# The example below send any host in double-click.net to a local
# web-server.
#address=/double-click.net/127.0.0.1

#penfoldq : not yet.
#

# --address (and --server) work with IPv6 addresses too.
#address=/www.thekelleys.org.uk/fe80::20d:60ff:fe36:f83

#penfoldq : not yet.
#

# You can control how dnsmasq talks to a server: this forces
# queries to 10.1.2.3 to be routed via eth1
# server=10.1.2.3@eth1

#penfoldq : expect only one interface at this time.
#

# and this sets the source (ie local) address used to talk to
# 10.1.2.3 to 192.168.1.1 port 55 (there must be a interface with that
# IP on the machine, obviously).
# server=10.1.2.3@192.168.1.1#55

#penfoldq : nope.
#

# If you want dnsmasq to change uid and gid to something other
# than the default, edit the following lines.
#user=
#group=

#penfoldq : default is fine.
#

# If you want dnsmasq to listen for DHCP and DNS requests only on
# specified interfaces (and the loopback) give the name of the
# interface (eg eth0) here.
# Repeat the line for more than one interface.
#interface=
# Or you can specify which interface _not_ to listen on
#except-interface=
# Or which to listen on by address (remember to include 127.0.0.1 if
# you use this.)
#listen-address=
# If you want dnsmasq to provide only DNS service on an interface,
# configure it as shown above, and then use the following line to
# disable DHCP and TFTP on it.
#no-dhcp-interface=

#penfoldq : all interfaces (only one) please.
#

# On systems which support it, dnsmasq binds the wildcard address,
# even when it is listening on only some interfaces. It then discards
# requests that it shouldn't reply to. This has the advantage of
# working even when interfaces come and go and change address. If you
# want dnsmasq to really bind only the interfaces it is listening on,
# uncomment this option. About the only time you may need this is when
# running another nameserver on the same machine.
#bind-interfaces

#penfoldq : as indicated, this is a very special use case we're not 
#           expecting to see.
#

# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/hosts, uncomment the
# following line.
#no-hosts
# or if you want it to read another file, as well as /etc/hosts, use
# this.
#addn-hosts=/etc/banner_add_hosts

#penfoldq : _maybe_ ... not sure. Start with just /etc/hosts, should be 
#           enough.
#

# Set this (and domain: see below) if you want to have a domain
# automatically added to simple names in a hosts-file.

#penfoldq : this is for /etc/hosts (not DHCP) so I think we want this.
#           but it might cause problems. suck it and see.
expand-hosts
#

# Set the domain for dnsmasq. this is optional, but if it is set, it
# does the following things.
# 1) Allows DHCP hosts to have fully qualified domain names, as long
#     as the domain part matches this setting.
# 2) Sets the "domain" DHCP option thereby potentially setting the
#    domain of all systems configured by DHCP
# 3) Provides the domain part for "expand-hosts"

# If there are multiple external tftp servers having a same name

# Set the limit on DHCP leases, the default is 150

#penfoldq : might need to increase this but not yet

# The DHCP server needs somewhere on disk to keep its lease database.

# the line below.
#dhcp-leasefile=/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases

#penfoldq : default is fine.
#

# Set the DHCP server to authoritative mode. In this mode it will barge in
# and take over the lease for any client which broadcasts on the network,
# whether it has a record of the lease or not. This avoids long timeouts
# when a machine wakes up on a new network. DO NOT enable this if there's
# the slightest chance that you might end up accidentally configuring a DHCP
# server for your campus/company accidentally. The ISC server uses
# the same option, and this URL provides more information:
# http://www.isc.org/files/auth.html

#penfoldq : certainly not until I've got this debugged but even then it
#           is probably best to leave this off

# Run an executable when a DHCP lease is created or destroyed.

#penfoldq : not sure
#

# Normally responses which come form /etc/hosts and the DHCP lease
# file have Time-To-Live set as zero, which conventionally means
# do not cache further. If you are happy to trade lower load on the
# server for potentially stale date, you can set a time-to-live (in
# seconds) here.

# If you want dnsmasq to detect attempts by Verisign to send queries

# registries which have implemented wildcard A records.

#penfoldq : will add this as soon as I find it necessary.
#

# If you want to fix up DNS results from upstream servers, use the

# This alias makes a result of 1.2.3.4 appear as 5.6.7.8

# and this maps 1.2.3.x to 5.6.7.x
#alias=1.2.3.0,5.6.7.0,255.255.255.0
